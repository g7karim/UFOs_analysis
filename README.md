# Deliverable 2: Summary Analysis


## Overview of Project:

As per Dana's request, the purpose of this analysis is to gather data from various UFO sources arond United States and include them in an easy to use webpage. Dana specifically would like to provide more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings and also allow users to filter through data to get specific results. Therefore filter criteria such as date, city, state, country and shape were added to the webpage. The webpage was created with JavaScript, html and css.


## Results: 

As mentioned, the webpage includes filter criteria on the left hand side such as date, city, state, country and shepe to make it easier for the user to search for more specific data. See the image for guidance:

### Summary:
The shortcomings of the websites is the search criteria does not allow ti search for specific word or sentence, even after using the filter criteria the user has to scroll through some data. The other shortcoming is that the data is not lives data but rather stored data. The data will always stay the same unless it is manually updated and changed. If not updated the webpage could have outdated and unreliable data. Those are the areas that need improvement in my view.
